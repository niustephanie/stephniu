				<p>“Sand collar of the Atlantic Moon Snail” uses names of marine mollusks found along the Atlantic Coast, based on labels found in the American Museum of Natural History’s shell hall. The map depicts a section of the Atlantic Coast around the southeast United States.</p>

				<p>“hen of the woods” (including the title) uses names of mushrooms found in North America and identified on the mobile application iNaturalist. The map depicts a section of the northeast Atlantic coast. Both maps come from Raven Maps.</p>

				<p>This collage pays tribute to the Samsui women, Singaporean women from the Samsui province in south China, and particularly their contributions to Christmas Island. I first learned about the Samsui women through an article by Christopher Su in The Islander, Christmas Island’s community newsletter, which notes:</p>
				<p><em>There are dozens of pages documenting Asian females as prostitutes in the local history books with the odd mention of them as ‘amah’ nannies to British children. Not one page is dedicated to the achievements of Asian women or recognition of their labour.</em></p>
				
				<p>The three photographs in this collage are the only known images to exist that depict the Samsui women on Christmas Island; all three show the women at work. What little we know about the women comes from state and national archives: they did hard manual labor. They wore distinctive red headscarves with a boxy silhouette. They came from the Samsui district. In my desire to imagine the Samsui women as more than just workers, as whole people with rich interior lives, I wrote a poem in Mandarin from the perspective of a Samsui woman writing home from Christmas Island.</p>

Text appearing in white boxes is quoted from Jan Adams and Marg Neales “Christmas Island – The Early Years” (1993), and The National Library of Singapore’s “Samsui women” by Koh, Qi Rui Vincent (December 2014).<br>
