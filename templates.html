					<p>Between 1864 and 1869, thousands of Chinese migrants toiled at a grueling pace and in perilous working conditions to help construct America’s first Transcontinental Railroad. The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project seeks to give a voice to the Chinese migrants whose labor on the Transcontinental Railroad helped to shape the physical and social landscape of the American West.</p>
					<p class="attribution">- From the project website</p>
					<p> The Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project is a landmark example of the power of research and visualization in unearthing previously untold histories. The history of the Chinese laborers who toiled for the railroad that connected America’s coasts was almost completely unwritten before this project. Relying on archaeological findings, oral histories of railroad worker descendants, and innovative visualization techniques, the project has created the first definitive history of the Chinese railroad workers that tells the story from their perspective. </p>
