  			<h1>She Has Dreamt Again<br> of Water</h1>
  			<p class="poem-title">Diode Editions, March 2022.</p>
  			<h4>Winner of the 2021 Diode Editions Chapbook Prize<br>

  			<p>"In her dazzling debut chapbook, Stephanie Niu dives into the depths of myth, family origin, and migration with tender, lyrical poems of remarkable craft, taking us on an expansive search for home. Bodies of water ebb and flow throughout, carrying the reader from Georgia to Michigan, from China to Christmas Island, as the speaker works to reclaim a primary world where “everything is worthy / of devotion.” Niu is a revelation, and her clear-eyed poems hum with elemental power."</p>

  			<p>"In <em>She Has Dreamt Again of Water</em>, Stephanie Niu’s brisk, imaginative poems name the fraught distances between daughter and family, self and memory, place and displacement. These are poems of inheritance and love written in a deft care, by a crystalline eye. What a striking debut to behold, one launching a life of poetry to follow. "</p>

  			<p>"Like a blast of seawater, Niu’s poems cleanse, refresh, and brace the reader. On dreams, Niu writes, 'There is no split, a real self and a dream self / to divide neatly.' On scuba diving, 'Everything is worthy / of devotion.' And though the sea binds this collection, it is the steadfastly real mother, and not the myth of the mother, who inhabits these poems. 'Look what I do for you,' she says. 'Even [a] skeleton becomes home,' murmurs Niu in response. Such exquisite, clear-eyed poems, they are an exultation of the natural world we will likely lose, and the intimacy that we may yet preserve."</p>
